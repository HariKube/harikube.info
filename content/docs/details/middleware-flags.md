 - `--listen-address`: Listen address of service. Default: `unix://harikube.sock`
 - `--endpoint`: Defines the default fallback database used to store any data not explicitly routed by the topology configuration
 - `--ca-file`: Path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file used to establish trust for the default database connection
 - `--cert-file`: Path to the client certificate file used to authenticate with the default database during TLS handshake
 - `--key-file`: Path to the private key file used in conjunction with the client certificate to authenticate the default database connection
 - `--skip-verify`: Controls whether the TLS client performs server certificate verification
 - `--log-format`: Log format to use. Options are 'plain' or 'json'. Default 'plain'
 - `--metrics-bind-address`: The address the metric endpoint binds to. Default `:8080`, set 0 to disable metrics serving
 - `--server-cert-file`: Path to the TLS certificate used by the middleware to secure incoming client connections
 - `--server-key-file`: Path to the private key used by the middleware to establish secure TLS communication with etcd-compatible clients
 - `--datastore-max-idle-connections`: Maximum number of idle connections retained by default datastore. If value = 0, the system default will be used. If value < 0, idle connections will not be reused
 - `--datastore-max-open-connections`: Maximum number of open connections used by default datastore. If value <= 0, then there is no limit
 - `--datastore-connection-max-lifetime`: Maximum amount of time a default database connection may be reused. If value <= 0, then there is no limit
 - `--datastore-connection-max-idle-lifetime`: Maximum amount of time a default database idle connection may be reused. If value <= 0, then there is no limit
 - `--slow-sql-threshold`: The duration which SQL executed longer than will be logged. Default 1s, set <= 0 to disable slow SQL log
 - `--slow-sql-warning-threshold`: The duration which SQL executed longer than will be logged at level warn. Default 5s
 - `--metrics-enable-profiling`: Enables Go performance profiling via net/http/pprof on the metrics bind address. Default is false
 - `--watch-progress-notify-interval`: Interval between periodic watch progress notifications. Default is 5s
 - `--emulated-etcd-version`: The emulated etcd version to return on a call to the status endpoint. Defaults to 3.5.13, in order to indicate support for watch progress notifications
 - `--compact-interval`: Interval between automatic compaction. Default is 5m
 - `--compact-interval-jitter`: Percentage of jitter to apply to interval durations. A value of 10 will apply a jitter of +/-10 percent to the interval duration. It cannot be negative, and must be less than 100. Default is 0
 - `--compact-timeout`: Timeout for automatic compaction. Default is 5s
 - `--compact-min-retain`: Minimum number of revisions to retain when compacting. Default is 1000
 - `--compact-batch-size`: Number of revisions to compact in a single batch. Default is 1000
 - `--poll-batch-size`: Number of revisions to poll in a single batch. Default is 500
 - `--debug`: Enable debug logging

Environment variables:
 - `TOPOLOGY_CONFIG`: File path for the main topology configuration, which is continuously scanned for modifications, supported formats are:
  - `file://<file-path>`
  - `http(s)://<file-url>` - Polling interval is 1 minute
  - `secret://<namespace>/<name>` - Ensure this secret is stored at main database, and strongly suggested to add finalizer to prevent deletion.  Files are consumed in name order
    - `TOPOLOGY_CONFIG_TLS_DIR`: Directory path for storing TLS files provided by topology secret, Default `./db/tls`
 - `LIST_MAX_ITEMS`: Max items for list operations. Default 1000
 - `ENABLE_GARBAGE_COLLECTION`: Enable garbage-collection, if Kubernetes garbage-collection is disabled
 - `DISABLE_STORAGE_LEVEL_FILTERING`: Disable storage level filtering
 - `ENABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH`: Enables pushing usage telemetry to HariKube central monitoring site `https://monitoring.harikube.info`
 - `CUSTOM_RESOURCE_DEFINITION_METADATA_FILE`: Locatin to store Custom Resource Definition metadata. Defaut: `./db/crds.json`
