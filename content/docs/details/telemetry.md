To continuously improve our software and deliver the best possible experience, we kindly ask you to enable telemetry. When enabled, your application will periodically send anonymized usage data to our central telemetry collector. This data helps us understand how the software is used in real-world scenarios and allows us to detect bugs, optimize performance, and prioritize new features.

We **do not collect any sensitive or personally identifiable information**. All collected data is strictly anonymized and used solely for diagnostic and analytical purposes. Examples include feature usage frequency, error events, and environment metadata like OS type or version.

Telemetry is entirely optional and enabled by `ENABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH` environment variable. By enabling it, you contribute to a better and more stable product for everyone. To enable telemetry, please ensure your network allows egress traffic to `https://monitoring.harikube.info`.

Thank you for supporting the project!
