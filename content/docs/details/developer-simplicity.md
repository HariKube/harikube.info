- Developers focus only on data structure and business logic
- It streamlines development by requiring no external libraries, resulting in a leaner, more secure codebase and reduced maintenance overhead

- Streamlines the development workflow by offering a true cloud-native experience
- Reducing infrastructure overhead and enabling faster iteration
- Leverages native Kubernetes capabilities such as RBAC, built-in eventing and messaging mechanisms, security policies, and admission webhooks to provide seamless integration with enterprise-grade infrastructure
