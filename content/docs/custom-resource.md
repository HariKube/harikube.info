## üì¶ Create Your First Custom Resource Definition

{{< code bash >}}kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/customresourcedefinition/shirt-resource-definition.yaml
{{< /code >}}

By default, the Kubernetes Controller Manager caches every resource to support background operations such as garbage collection and internal indexing.
To reduce memory usage and improve performance in high-volume environments, you can label specific resources with `skip-controller-manager-metadata-caching=true` to exclude them from being cached. That means Kubernetes can't clean-up resources by `ownerReference`. Select a database which automatic GC is supported, or you have to do garbage collection on your own.

### üí° Ensure Label with Mutation Admission Webhook

MutatingAdmissionPolicies allow you to modify (or "mutate") incoming requests to the Kubernetes API.

However, if you only need a declarative policy to ensure a label on each resources, the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` is a simpler and more effective choice. We've provided a simple example below, but for complete and detailed information, please refer to the following the link: [Mutating Admission Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/mutating-admission-policy).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To use the feature, enable the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate (which is off by default) and set `--runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=true` on the `kube-apiserver`.
