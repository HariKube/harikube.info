## ðŸ“¦ Create Your First Custom Resource

{{< code bash >}}kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/customresourcedefinition/shirt-resource-definition.yaml
{{< /code >}}

By default, the Kubernetes Controller Manager caches every resource to support background operations such as garbage collection and internal indexing.
To reduce memory usage and improve performance in high-volume environments, you can label specific resources with `skip-controller-manager-metadata-caching=true` to exclude them from being cached. That means Kubernetes can't clean-up resources by `ownerReference`. Select a database which automatic GC is supported, or you have to do garbage collection on your own.

{{< code bash >}}cat | kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
