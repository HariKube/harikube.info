## Kubernetes won the orchestration war. Application development is still losing.

Kubernetes is everywhere - yet most "cloud-native" teams still spend ~50% of engineering time on infrastructure glue: APIs, databases, messaging, RBAC, and internal platform abstractions that every team rebuilds differently.

### This whitepaper argues that this isn’t a tooling problem. It’s an architectural ceiling.

What this paper actually shows:

- Why most microservices are "cloud-native in the name only"?
- How CRD-driven architectures eliminate authz, queues, and glue code?
- How storage-level routing enables real multi-tenancy and scale?
- Where eventual consistency fits - and where it doesn’t?
- Why this approach differs fundamentally from existing solutions?

#### No frameworks.
#### No new APIs.
#### No vendor lock-in.

### Just Kubernetes - used as an application platform, with HariKube.
