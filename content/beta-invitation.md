# üöÄ Shape Our Future: Join the Open Beta!

{{< columns >}}

**Scale your Kubernetes workloads with precision. Distribute your data like a pro.**

We‚Äôre excited to invite you to participate in the **Open Beta of HariKube** ‚Äî a groundbreaking Kubernetes middleware that brings powerful database routing and dynamic data topologies into your cluster, and turns your Kubernetes into a real Platform-as-a-Service for microservices.

HariKube enables you to separate storage logic from application code, so you can scale, isolate, or route data across multiple databases ‚Äî all while keeping full compatibility with Kubernetes-native APIs like CRDs, RBAC, and webhooks. Whether you're running a multi-tenant SaaS, orchestrating microservices with strict data boundaries, or optimizing database-heavy analytics workloads, HariKube helps you:

**Simplifies service development** by letting developer teams to focus purely on business logig.

**Decouple infrastructure from business logic** using declarative database policies per service, namespace, or resource.

**Offload ETCD pressure** by moving business data out of Kubernetes‚Äô core state store into multiple databases.

**Introduce low-latency and high-throughput data¬†store**¬†using Cloud-native design patterns.

**Compose flat or hierarchical data topologies** tailored to your service mesh, tenancy model, or data access patterns.

The beta includes access to HariKube‚Äôs core components, dynamic database routing system and a customized Kubernetes version to achieve support of huge datasets (optional). By default, it integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes and turns it into a real PaaS. Setup is minimal ‚Äî you can get started with just a YAML file and a running database.

Participation is **free during 6-month trial**, and governed by our EULA. You‚Äôll be among the first to shape a new standard in Kubernetes-native database management ‚Äî and your feedback will help optimize performance, usability, and production-readiness for GA.

# üîç Why Join the HariKube Beta?

**Modern Kubernetes environments often struggle** when:

- ETCD becomes a bottleneck under the weight of growing stateful resources.
- Multi-tenant applications need strict data isolation and dynamic routing logic.
- Developers are forced to deliver storage assumptions within application logic.
- Infrastructure evolution is blocked by monolithic CRDs or rigid topology design.

**HariKube solves these problems** by introducing:

‚úÖ A Kubernetes-native Data Routing Layer
Route workloads to dedicated or shared databases based on declarative topology configs ‚Äî with native support for per-namespace, per-resource, or tree-structured hierarchies.

‚úÖ Pluggable Backends with zero downtime
Choose the best storage for each use case: SQLite for lightweight services or MySQL/PostgreSQL for production-grade performance.

‚úÖ ETCD Offload with Full API Compatibility
Your existing Kubernetes tooling keeps working ‚Äî but the data doesn‚Äôt live in ETCD anymore. Think: safer upgrades, less compaction pressure, and no schema hacks.

# üìù Share your experiences!

We're so excited to have you as part of our open beta! Your feedback is crucial in helping us build the best possible product.

üìà To help us improve, we ask that you **enable telemetry** in your settings. This allows us to gather anonymous data on how the app is being used, which helps us identify and fix bugs faster.

üé´ As you use the app, we want to hear from you. If you encounter any bugs or technical issues, please email our support team at support@inspirnation.eu to open a ticket.

‚≠ê If you have a positive experience, we'd love to hear about it! Please share any success stories or general feedback with us at support@inspirnation.eu. Your insights will help us understand what's working well and what we should focus on as we prepare for our full launch.
