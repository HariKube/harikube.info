We are not a typical Kubernetes team. We are building a middleware that transforms Kubernetes into a true Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). We are looking for a **Senior Golang + Kubernetes Platform Engineer** to join our team and help us build the next generation of our cloud-native platform.

## About the Role

As a Senior Golang + Kubernetes Engineer, you will:

 - Architect and build core components of our platform as a service using Go (Golang).
 - Develop and maintain Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to automate complex platform workflows.
 - Design and implement microservices that are scalable, resilient, and observable.
 - Designing and building intuitive, user-friendly CLI and migration tools in Go.
 - Developing and managing CI/CD pipelines for our tools and platform components.
 - Collaborate with product and engineering teams to define the future of our platform and its capabilities.
 - Contribute to the full software development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operation.
 - Writing high-quality, maintainable code with a strong focus on testing and documentation.

## Requirements

 - 4+ years of experience in backend or platform engineering.
 - Deep expertise in Go (Golang) and a strong understanding of its concurrency model and ecosystem.
 - Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to debug distributed systems.

## Nice to Have

 - Contributions to open-source projects, particularly in the cloud-native ecosystem.
 - Knowledge of monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
 - Experience with databases, both relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., ETCD, Redis, MongoDB).
 - Extensive experience with Kubernetes, including API server interactions, controllers, and resource management.
 - Proven experience developing Kubernetes Operators or controllers.
 - Strong knowledge of microservices architecture and design patterns.

## Benefits

 - Competitive salary and equity package
 - Flexible working hours
 - Remote-first culture with home office stipend
 - Generous learning and development budget for courses and conferences
