  - title: "Per-namespace database isolation"
    description: "HariKube enables each Kubernetes namespace to use a dedicated database, ensuring strict separation of data between teams, tenants, or environments. This enhances security, simplifies compliance, and prevents noisy-neighbor performance issues."
  - title: "Dedicated databases per resource type"
    description: "HariKube allows each resource type—such as custom controllers, CRDs, or microservices—to be backed by its own database. This separation improves performance tuning, access control, and fault isolation across distinct workloads."
  - title: "Strong workload boundaries"
    description: "HariKube enforces clear separation between workloads by isolating their data at the database level, reducing cross-service interference and limiting the blast radius of failures—critical for secure, multi-tenant, and regulated environments."
  - title: "Reduces Security Scope and Maintenance Overhead"
    description: "By isolating data into separate databases per resource, service, or namespace, HariKube limits the impact of security vulnerabilities and database maintenance or downtimes."

In today’s multi-tenant, cloud-native environments, maintaining strict data boundaries is not just a best practice—it’s a compliance requirement. However, traditional Kubernetes deployments store all data in a shared ETCD store, making it difficult to enforce clear separation between teams, services, or environments.

HariKube addresses this gap by introducing fine-grained, database-level data isolation, enabling organizations to achieve strong security postures while also simplifying operational complexity.
Why Fine-Grained Isolation Matters

 - **Security and Least Privilege** – Isolating data per namespace or resource type ensures that sensitive workloads are never exposed to unintended access. Teams can enforce RBAC and network policies with confidence, knowing each unit of data resides in a self-contained backend.

 - **Scoped impact in case of breaches or maintenance** – With HariKube’s isolated database architecture, a data breach, misconfiguration, or maintenance event affects only the specific resource, namespace, or service involved—preventing widespread impact across the entire cluster.

 - **Regulatory Compliance** – Whether it's GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, HariKube makes it easier to meet data residency, access control, and auditability requirements by physically separating data for different tenants, environments, or application domains.

 - **Simplified Auditing and Maintenance** – Managing backups, access policies, and upgrades becomes more manageable when each database maps clearly to a workload or tenant. There's no ambiguity in ownership or access rights.

HariKube brings these capabilities to Kubernetes with zero disruption to existing workflows. Developers continue using native APIs, while platform teams gain the fine-grained control they need to run secure, compliant, and scalable systems.
