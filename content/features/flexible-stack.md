features:
  - title: "Pluggable database backends"
    description: "HariKube supports a modular architecture that allows seamless integration with popular relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Teams can choose the backend that best fits each workload, and mix multiple database types within the same cluster to match performance, scalability, or compliance requirements."
  - title: "Dynamic data topologies"
    description: "HariKube supports both flat and hierarchical data topologies, allowing you to shape your infrastructure around your teams, workloads, or compliance zones. You can isolate data by namespace, resource type, or region—all without changing application logic. As your platform evolves, your data topology evolves with it. Flexibility is built in, not bolted on."
  - title: "Transparent Kubernetes-native integration"
    description: "HariKube is designed to work natively within the Kubernetes ecosystem, leveraging built-in features like RBAC, admission webhooks, events, and security policies. This tight integration ensures a consistent and secure experience without requiring changes to existing cluster workflows or tooling."
  - title: "Decoupled resource management"
    description: "HariKube separates the concerns of resource definition, storage, and access—freeing your teams to focus on what matters. Developers define CRDs as usual, while the platform handles where and how the data is stored. This decoupling improves scalability, simplifies multi-tenancy, and enhances operational flexibility without changing your Kubernetes workflow."

Modern cloud-native platforms demand dynamic infrastructure, interoperable systems, and resilient data routing at scale. As Kubernetes environments grow in complexity, teams must evolve infrastructure independently from application logic—without disrupting developers or compromising control.
HariKube meets this challenge with a flexible, composable architecture that integrates cleanly into existing Kubernetes workflows and adapts to real-world production needs.

HariKube introduces a declarative data routing layer that enables teams to scale workloads across dedicated databases, optimize performance by workload type, and isolate data by tenant, namespace, or resource—all while maintaining full compatibility with Kubernetes-native APIs.

The result?

A powerful abstraction layer for platform engineers that enables secure scaling, flexible infrastructure evolution, and seamless integration with diverse storage systems—without developer disruption or infrastructure sprawl.
